# NLP Project: IMapBook Collaborative Discussions Classification

A project for the Natural Language Processing course at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science at University
of Ljubljana. 

The task is related to a project, where research on book comprehension for primary school pupils was conducted using
the IMapBook system. The pupils formed groups and could use the IMapBook system to communicate with each other and form
collaborative responses to questions related to a book they read. The main goal is to classify messages from the pupils' 
conversations taken from the IMApBook systems using NLP techniques and determine the classification performance.

## Data
Approximately 800 chat messages to be classified into predefined classes

The database also contains additional information such as message senders, group names, timestamps of messages etc.

## How to Run
This section will be expanded when we implement a number of working classification methods
and are able to generate results.

## The Report
A continuously updated report for the project is available in the root directory with the name "report.pdf".
