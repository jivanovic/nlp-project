0,General Question,$Well? $
1,Content Discussion,$Maier seems to have very definite opinions.$
2,Content Discussion,$He thinks highly of himself and his aesthetic.$
3,Content Discussion,$ I do think it was an error on the part of the reporter to begin the discussion with bringing up another designer.$
4,Content Discussion,$ Posen, in particular, seems drastically different from Maier.$
5,Content Discussion,$Posen has a flamboyancy that is in stark contrast to Maier's minimalist look.$
6,Content Discussion,$Maier would be frustrated and angry in 'wasting' his time focusing on someone outside of his design sensibility.$
7,Content Question,$Do we think that Maier will return, $
8,Content Question,$and we want to explore that part of the story? $
9,Content Question,$Or do we want to focus on the reporter's experience?$
10,Feedback,$Great questions, Michelle! $
11,Content Discussion,$Maier said he was going to return, but he’s such a jerk.$
12,Content Discussion,$We could stick with the reporter’s perspective.$
13,Content Question,$But don’t we have to decide if Maier comes back?$
14,Content Question,$How would the reporter even know how to get out of the building?$
15,Response,$Meg, I agree with what you said  $
16,Content Discussion,$about the reporter starting the discussion with mentioning another designer.$
17,Response,$ I also agree with you, Michelle, on focusing on the reporter's experience.$
18,General Comment,$ Had that been me, I'd be so nervous!$
19,Response,$As you said, Meg, $
20,Content Discussion,$Maier is a jerk and it's evident already!$
21,Content Discussion,$I feel like Maier is playing a cruel game on the reporter and this will probably turn into some kind of metaphor or lesson of sorts.$
22,General Comment,$It sounds like we are all in agreement overall. $
23,Assignment Instructions,$The assignment asks what happens next" $
24,Assignment Instructions,$& that the answer be tied to "design  in some way.""$
25,Assignment Instructions,$So, what are our options? $
26,Content Discussion,$ I can think of: A. Maier does not come back or Maier does come back $
27,Content Discussion,$(I'm leaning towards he comes back, since that's what he says he was going to do$
28,Content Discussion,$B: Maier is helpful and responsive or he is a jerk $
29,Content Discussion,$(I'm leaning towards him being a jerk, since that is what he is). $
30,Content Question,$ If Maier didn't come back, what would the reporter do?$
31,General Comment,$OK, guys. $
32,Logistics,$ I am starting a draft below$
33,Logistics,$Please update with your edits & inputs.$
34,Content Discussion,$Here's one way it could go!$
35,Feedback,$I like those changes!!$
36,General Comment,$I'm not sure how we should close out the story. $
37,Assignment Question,$Any ideas?$
38,Feedback,$Haha the new designs you just added to the story could be people in the nude! $
39,Content Discussion,$We could have Maier leave again but the narrator, who is now used to this charade, isn't worried;$
40,Content Discussion,$however, we could leave him in this minimalistic room for hours and hours. $
41,Content Discussion,$He could become extremely bored with nothing to do or look at.$
42,Content Discussion,$In the end, he could have the realization that minimalism isn't as great as Maier makes it out to be and could go on to sabotage the designer in some over-the-top stunt...$
43,General Comment,$Sorry that my two ideas were so disconnected…$
44,Logistics,$I pressed enter on accident and it submitted my response!$
45,Content Discussion,$So idea one is nude models and idea 2 is being locked in minimalism for way too long.$
46,Content Discussion,$But I am game for any other suggestions!$
47,General Comment,$(I really enjoy reading but cannot come up with a plot for the life of me! Haha)$
48,Feedback,$I like both of your ideas! $
49,Content Discussion,$It could be a funny way to end the story with him basically stripping $
50,Content Discussion,$(literally) $
51,Content Discussion,$away everything from his designs so that the models are nude$
52,Non-verbal,$LOL$
53,Feedback,$It's perfect! $
54,Feedback,$Good work Rachel!$
55,Logistics,$Added one more line. $
56,Discussion Wrap-up,$I'll mark it as Submitted!$
57,Content Discussion,$I think the system is looking for a "too busy" response because of the pattern on the jacket. $
58,Content Discussion,$ I also think that the collars of both the jacket and the shirt underneath it are too similar and would not lie down smoothly.$
59,Content Discussion,$I think the system is looking for a "too busy" response because of the pattern on the jacket. $
60,Content Discussion,$I also think that the collars of both the jacket and the shirt underneath it are too similar and would not lie down smoothly.$
61,Assignment Instructions,$I think we're supposed to come up with what happens next in the story.$
62,Logistics,$What do we want our button to do? $
63,Content Discussion,$I wrote something about a hidden door but I don't know what would be behind it.$
64,Content Discussion,$Another minimalist room $
65,Non-verbal,$lol$
66,Content Discussion,$Pretty bizarre situation$
67,Content Discussion,$kind of ominous,$

69,Response,$Oh wow! $
70,Response,$Just read below,$
71,Feedback,$ I love it!$
72,Feedback,$I love that!$
73,Content Discussion,$Thoughts on what happens next: Wow, I know that designers tend to be a bit quirky, but his guy is done right weird. Not only do I not know exactly how long I've been in here since he took my smart phone, I also have no foreseeable way out!$
74,Content Discussion,$ Wow, I know that designers tend to be a bit quirky, but his guy is done right weird.$

78,Content Discussion,$Did I offend him? $
79,Content Discussion,$He left right after I mentioned Zac Posen.$
80,Content Discussion,$Maybe he hates Zac Posen$
81,Content Discussion,$- or Target!?$
82,Content Discussion,$Who knows, this guy is an enigma.$
83,Content Discussion,$Just then, Maier walked back in - with none other than Zac Posen himself. $
84,Content Discussion,$I believe you two have met?" he said dryly.$
85,Content Discussion,$Hey  nice to see you again  said Posen. Mr. Po$
86,Logistics,$SUBMITTED$
87,Greeting,$Hello. $
88,Content Discussion,$My assumption is$
89,Content Discussion,$that the emphasis on barbarism implies that she sent him to the lion.$
90,Response,$I agree with Cassandra's noticing $
91,Content Discussion,$of the author's word choice of barbarism.$
92,Feedback,$I loved the addition of $
93,Content Discussion,$Her lover would die and never love another." $
94,Content Discussion,$ Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion."$
95,Logistics,$Submitted$
96,Content Discussion,$If the princess possesses the same semi-barbaric trait as her father, then it would seem she directed her lover to the door with the tiger. $
97,Content Discussion,$Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?$
98,Content Discussion,$It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;$
99,Content Discussion,$however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is $
100,Incomplete/Typo,$mor$
101,Content Discussion,$more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,$
102,Content Discussion,$given the two terrible choices,$
103,Content Discussion,$she would send him to his death.$
104,Content Discussion,$If the King were to discover that his daughter broke the law by secretly sending her lover towards the door on the right$
105,Content Discussion,$he would have to send his daughter to the arena for a judgement. $
106,Content Discussion,$I would imagine,$
107,Content Discussion,$given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.$
108,Content Discussion,$However, I also do not$
109,Incomplete/Typo,$ima$
110,Content Discussion,$imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. $
111,Content Discussion,$Perhaps, instead of sending his daughter to the arena, he would send the person who gave her the information about the two doors instead.$
112,Content Discussion,$ It could be argued that the informant is more guilty than the princess and is sent to show the kingdom the consequence of such behaviors.$
113,General Comment,$(Sorry it came out as three separate messages! For some reason, it wouldn't post my full response at once.)$
114,Response,$I agree with Ashely $
115,Content Discussion,$ that the Princess's barbaric traits will lead the princess to send her lover to his death.$
116,Content Discussion,$She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between "the lady" and the princess's lover.$
117,Content Discussion,$The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.$
118,Response,$I also agree with Ashley$
119,Content Discussion,$that the king's adoration of his daughter would stop him from sending his daughter into the arena.$
120,Content Discussion,$I had orgininally thought that the king would either keep her secret out of love for his daughter, or out of barbaric pride that she sent her lover to his grizzly death, or a combination of the two. $
121,Content Discussion,$If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.$
122,Content Discussion,$I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an $
123,Incomplete/Typo,$opportun$
124,Content Discussion,$I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an opportunity for the king to re-examine the practice.$
125,Feedback,$ I like this idea!$
126,Assignment Instructions,$The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. $
127,Instruction Question,$Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? $
128,General Comment,$I'm overall a little confused by this entire module $
129,General Comment,$and am open to other thoughts/suggestions.$
130,Response,$I think you are correct, Ashley. $
131,Logistics,$I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response$
132,Logistics,$I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result$
133,Assignment Question,$What were your thoughts?$
134,Feedback,$That sounds great, Meg! $
135,Response,$Thanks for taking the lead on the first draft$
136,Logistics,$I’ll check in soon and add to it $
137,Emoticon/Non-verbal,$👍$
138,Logistics,$SUBMITTED$
139,Opening statement,$I am late to the discussion $
140,Logistics,$but I figured I might as well add to this$
141,Response,$because while I agree with the first part said$
142,Content Discussion,$ I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.$
143,Content Discussion,$Just because she comes from a semi-barbaric King does not make her semi-barbaric. $
144,Content Discussion,$Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one$
145,Content Discussion,$While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make$
146,Incomplete/Typo,$s$
147,Content Discussion,$make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. $
148,Content Discussion,$Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.$
149,Content Discussion,$However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind$
150,Content Discussion,$and Meg brought and interesting topic of the difference between how the princess rambles on about him opening the door with the lady but barely mentions him opening the door with the tiger.$
151,Content Discussion,$The princess has no qualms about her lover dying but$
152,Content Discussion,$had great grief over her lover in another’s arms.$
153,Content Discussion,$As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. $
154,Content Question,$ Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?$
155,Content Question,$Who knows? $
156,Content Discussion,$Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him$
157,Content Discussion,$Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?$
158,Content Question,$What would happen then?$
159,Incomplete/Typo,$uwgyeu$
160,Content Discussion,$Part 1: For this question, our team decided that the princess chose the door with the tiger. $
161,Content Discussion,$This is based on the story's emphasis on the royal family's semi barbaric" nature.$
162,Content Discussion,$ In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating "her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman" (pp. 10).$
163,Content Discussion,$This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot$
164,Incomplete/Typo,$ha"$
165,Content Question,$What do you guys think? $
166,Content Question,$Do you think that she kills him or saves him?$
167,Content Question,$What would you do in her place?$
168,Content Discussion,$I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. $
169,Content Discussion,$I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.$
170,Content Discussion,$After all, it is a two way road and she is being punished right along with him for getting caught by the king as well.$
171,Content Discussion,$ I also think that even if the king finds out that she knew the doors he will know that either choice that she makes is a punishment in its own right. She suffers either way $
172,Incomplete/Typo,$w$
173,Content Discussion,$And what if the king already knew that she had broken the law. $
174,Content Discussion,$Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before$
175,Content Discussion,$Maybe this was her punishment.$
176,Content Discussion,$Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.$
177,Content Discussion,$It would be just a thing that this King would do I think.$
178,Feedback,$Kyra, those are some good thoughts! $
179,Content Discussion,$I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.$
180,Content Discussion,$ I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.$
181,Content Discussion,$So I'm leaning more toward she sends him to the tiger's door.$
182,Content Discussion,$But I do also think that it is possible that the King could be in on it too. $
183,Content Discussion,$He could know that she knows which door is which and he seems like the type of king to enjoy that punishment$
184,Response,$Emilie I can see that. $
185,Content Question,$What would you do in her place?$
186,Content Question,$Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? $
187,Content Discussion,$I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner$
188,Content Discussion,$ It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. $
189,Content Discussion,$I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.$
190,Content Discussion,$I mean there are other guys out there after all.$
191,Response,$I agree.$
192,Content Discussion,$ Personally, I would save him. $
193,Content Discussion,$I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. $
194,Content Discussion,$I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.$
195,Response,$And that's true! $
196,Content Discussion,$There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,$
197,Content Discussion,$I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else$
198,Content Discussion,$I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself$
199,Response,$I agree with that so much! $
200,Content Discussion,$But I'm not sure how this princess would think.$
201,Instuction Question,$Do we know how many people are part of this group? $
202,Logistics,$We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer$
203,Response,$I'm not sure! $
204,Response,$I tried looking for a "particpants" button or something and I couldn't find one.$
205,Response,$I couldn't either.$
206,Logistics,$I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too$
207,General Comment,$You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?$
208,Response,$I'm also in LIS6303!$
209,Response,$okay awesome! $
210,Logistics,$I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.$
211,Response,$Good idea!$
212,Content Question,$So how do you guys think we should end it?$
213,Response,$I'm honestly okay with either ending, $
214,Content Discussion,$but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. $
215,General Comment,$That's just my opinion though.$
216,Logistics,$Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. $
217,Content Discussion,$I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.$
218,Content Discussion,$How do you think it should end, Emilie?$
219,Logistics,$Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.$
220,Content Discussion,$I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. $
221,Content Discussion,$My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.$
222,Content Discussion,$I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.$
223,Feedback,$I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra$
224,Content Discussion,$about how she may have felt guilty.$
225,Content Discussion,$As for Part 2, I have a theory. $
226,Content Discussion,$I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.$
227,Content Discussion,$BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.$
228,Content Discussion,$HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.$
229,Content Discussion,$This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together$
230,General Comment,$But that's just what I was thinking.$
231,General Comment,$ I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on$
232,Feedback,$Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. $
233,Content Discussion,$This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!$
234,Content Discussion,$That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.$
235,Logistics,$And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin $
236,Emoticon/Non-verbal,$lol $
237,General Comment,$(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing)$
238,Logistics,$Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.$
239,Feedback,$Flipping a coin may not be the worst idea, honestly! $
240,Logistics,$I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. $
241,General Comment,$That's fun$
242,Response,$Glad you like that idea $
243,Emoticon/Non-verbal,$:D$
244,Response,$I think it would be fun too!$
245,General Comment,$Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.$
246,Feedback,$That's a creative idea!$
247,Feedback,$ I like it$
248,Feedback,$Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! $
249,Feedback,$That's some amazing writing! $
250,General Comment,$Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!$
251,Response,$Awww thank you so much!$
252,Feedback,$Ahhh I love your response too!$
253,Assignment Question,$Finished! How does that sound?$
254,Feedback,$it's wonderful!$
255,Instruction Question,$Any idea on how to submit it?$
256,Assignment Instructions,$I think we just leave it here? I'm not totally sure$
257,Assignment Instructions,$Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. $
258,Response,$So I don't know. $
259,Response,$Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.$
260,Response,$Maybe! $
261,Response,$Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there$
262,Response,$Yeah that makes sense.$
263,Opening statement,$darla$
264,Content Discussion,$Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,$
265,Content Discussion,$and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.$
266,Content Discussion,$He sentences her to the same trial.$
267,Content Discussion,$Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. $
268,Content Discussion,$ The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.$
269,General Comment,$I would hope though$
270,Content Discussion,$that the lady is behind the door; that the princess might be able to also feel that to take another human life, even when that life has so greatly wronged you, is far worse than to $
271,Incomplete/Typo,$experien$
272,Feedback,$^Gina, that is a really interesting point that you make, $
273,Content Discussion,$that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. $
274,Content Discussion,$The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, $
275,Content Discussion,$but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply.$
276,Feedback,$That's a really insightful point, Gina!$
277,General Comment,$I hadn't thought of when I read the piece$
278,Greeting,$Hi John, $
279,Content Discussion,$I feel that it would be fitting for the king to sentence her to the same trial, because they king and princess are both constantly described as semi-barbaric" throughout the text.$
280,Content Discussion,$There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him."$
281,Logistics ,$I have added to the story$
282,Content Discussion,$After another hour of wandering the uninteresting minimalist room, $
283,Content Discussion,$he decided to try the door again, still with no luck.$
284,Content Discussion,$He continued to place his fingers in the depressions of the heavy stainless door and pull, pull, pull. $
285,Content Discussion,$The door did not budge an inch.$
286,Content Discussion,$ Finally, after another hour and more pulling at the door, he frustratedly kicked at the door.$
287,Content Discussion,$It swung open easily. $
288,Content Discussion,$An instance of dealing with nonintuitive design! $

309,Content Discussion,$...  expensive housing is not sustainable ...$
310,Content Discussion,$...  and contributed to the spread of the disease.$
311,Content Discussion,$1.) The article discusses the way in which design always looks forward.$
312,Content Discussion,$. The problem is that designers tend to design towards a future that is better where we have the same resources and less/similar problems. $
313,Content Discussion,$ As we're faced with climate change and catastrophes causes by this kind of design, designers have to start designing towards a future bent on sustainability.$
314,Content Discussion,$2.) We should consider prototypes that will create a sustainable future in measurable steps that won't leave people in urban areas or people in poverty behind.$

339,General Comment,$Playing Frankenstein with our ideas$
340,Content Question,$Can you refresh me on what people in the Amazon are doing?$
341,Content Discussion,$She studies bridges made from living roots in Meghalaya, India, and advanced canal farming around Lake Titicaca in Peru by the Incan peoples. $
342,Content Discussion,$Where “Designs for Different Futures” feels high-tech in its imagination — envisioning, for example, that humans might perhaps one day be cloned from DNA extracted from gum left under park benches —$
343,Content Discussion,$ — Lo-TEK imagines that the knowledge of how to survive the future is already embedded in low-energy, often ancient practices.$
344,Content Discussion,$That was from the urban designer and activist Julia Watson seeks answers from Indigenous peoples around the world, because of their long practice in handling climatological disasters and other unforeseen events.$
345,Content Discussion,$Yes, the future of design might be to look towards the low-energy methods of the past.$
346,Content Question,$ A question this article brought up for me was is technology helping us or harming us?$
347,Content Discussion,$The past or the low-tech cultures she is studying.$
348,Content Discussion,$From the 2019 book “Lo-TEK” (a response to the old architectural and design movement called high-tech, whose most famous example is the 1977 Centre Pompidou in Paris, by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, with its facade of exposed metal innards),$
349,External Material,$This isn't directly in the article, ...$
350,External Material,$...but Teresa made me also think that one way to invest in our future is to recruit, support, and mentor designers from marginalized communities with perspectives most mainstream designers don't have. $
351,Assignment Question,$Do y'all mind if I add that?$
352,Feedback,$I like that, Jessica$
353,Response,$Awesome.$
354,Content Discussion,$I think we could add a section on how design towards the future might actually look at ways to use less technology$
355,Response,$Sure!$
356,General Comment,$I think we're looking good$
357,Assignment Question,$Anything else yall want to discuss$

371,Discussion Wrap-up,$Thank you, you too!$
372,Discussion Wrap-up,$Thank you! You too <3$
373,Content Discussion,$1. The article relates to the design perspective because design is always needing to evolve with the world around us.$
374,Content Discussion,$ As the pandemic has changed so many aspects of life, design perspective must change along with it.$
375,Content Discussion,$2. Prototypes for the future need to involve both sustainable energies ...$
376,Content Discussion,$...and potentially designs that may reverse the current damages we are doing.$
377,Content Discussion,$With the way things are going, the environment must be a huge factor in considering design for a resilient future.$
378,Assignment Instructions,$I think potentially the question is supposed to read How does the article content relate to the design perspective?$
379,Content Discussion,$The article discusses how design has influenced the way we live, ...$
380,Content Discussion,$...but also how the world events have also changed and influenced design as well.$
381,Content Discussion,$ Covid-19 is used as example to illustrate how designers must adapt and rework traditional ideas to meet the current needs of a population.$
382,Content Discussion,$The design perspective is looking at a situation with an artful and detailed eye, ultimately coming up with a design that will be aesthetically pleasing and as ergonomic as possible.$
383,Content Discussion,$Renewable sources of energy, more efficient recycling programs, less dependence on oil, plastic, and single-use items, and a global mental adjustment of the meaning of success.$
384,Content Discussion,$ Corporations must be held responsible for the byproducts or waste that they create as a result of production, pre and post production.$
385,Content Discussion,$They need to produce less to start,...$
386,Content Discussion,$ but also should should be forced to safety handle their waste, which also means accepting their packaging back that they recycle at their own cost.$
387,Content Discussion,$ We should demand that designers create for a less materialistic world.$
388,Content Discussion,$Less is more should be the new motto moving forward.$
389,Content Discussion,$The article content relates to the design perspective because it talks about design.$
390,Content Discussion,$Prototypes that should be considered for a resilient future include cars that run on electricity, plexiglass panes to keep people safe in a covid world.$
391,Content Discussion,$For Part I, the article relates to the design perspective as it illustrates the diverse meanings of design ...$
392,Content Discussion,$... and the how various fields utilize it.$
393,Content Discussion,$ For Part II, with COVD19 still being problematic, there will be more developments in designs that allow people to be distanced but still together.$
394,Content Discussion,$For Part 1, the article discusses the problems that can arise when trying to define design ...$
395,Content Discussion,$... and how people must adapt to the changing world.$
396,Content Discussion,$ Part two- Discussion of climate change and COVID-19 working to find a way for people to physically distance but have social interaction.$
397,Logistics,$Matthew said he would be able to get on later tonight.$
398,Logistics,$ I am planning on checking in later to see what he adds ...$

406,Assignment Question,$Any comments, concerns, criticism?$
407,Content Discussion,$The design perspective is a coherent set of values and aspects emphasized by the designer in a given design situation. $
408,Content Discussion,$This article's content discusses the design perspective of individuals tasked to think about design in a future which is unknown and unpredictable$
409,Content Discussion,$Prototypes that should be considered for a resilient future should include buildings which are environmentally sound $
410,Content Discussion,$as well as structurally strong enough to deal with the effects of climate changes$
411,Content Discussion,$ We are experiencing more extreme weather. $
412,Incomplete/typo,$Ou$
413,Content Discussion,$Design Perspective is a unique mindset which encompasses the influence of past design and of future.  $
414,Content Discussion,$The article emphasizes that the design perspective will be needed for us to sustain as a population. $
415,Content Discussion,$Prototypes for a resilient future would include farming that doesn't need fertilizer,$
416,Content Discussion,$housing developments that are self-sustaining using recycled materials, $
417,Content Discussion,$and other items that would reduce our stamp on the environment.$

458,Greeting,$Hi group members....$
459,Logistics,$how do you want to approach this assignment?$
460,Logistics,$In previous classes with groups $
461,Logistics,$we all responded to the questions and then meshed them together for our final answer.$
462,Logistics,$Would that work for everyone?$
463,Response,$It works for me...$
464,Content Discussion,$The article relates to design perspective because it describes how the different things happening relate and interact within a community and environment.$
465,Content Discussion,$Prototypes that have the ability to improve how we live would help to create a more resilient future.$
466,Content Discussion,$We are going to need to create structures that can support the changing climate and weather.$
467,Content Discussion,$Prototypes such as multi-functional buildings/spaces should be concerned for a resilient future.$
468,Logistics,$I think we all can contribute to the response over several days.$
469,Logistics,$ Feel free to edit and add as you see fit.$
470,Logistics,$This is due by Wednesday, November 25th.$
471,Logistics,$I have entered my piece. $
472,Logistics,$Please feel free to edit it if you think it can be improved.$
473,Response,$Thanks Alyssa!$
474,Feedback,$ Looks great.$
475,Logistics,$ I will change the title to Submitted tonight.$
476,General Comment,$Vanya emailed asked us to finish.  $
477,Logistics,$I went ahead and submitted.$
478,Content Discussion,$1) I think the design perspective is discussed in detail in the article because it impacts how we plan our communities, gatherings, social and living spaces. $
479,Content Discussion,$And how these things are all planned out impacts the environment into which they are placed.$
480,Content Discussion,$2) I'm not sure what is meant by prototypes, $
481,Content Discussion,$but we certainly need to take into consideration the impact our development has on the local and global environment.$
482,Content Discussion,$It relates to the design perspective because design is about everything$
483,Content Discussion,$-not just furniture and clothes-$
484,Content Discussion,$it's about designing indoor and outdoor spaces, infrastructure, cities, etc.$
485,Content Discussion,$Designers are at the heart of creating a new future.$
486,Content Discussion,$It takes environment into account.$
487,Content Discussion,$I think cities and parks must be designed differently so that they contribute to a resilient future.$
488,Content Discussion/Outside Material,$There's a park somewhere in Korea I believe, that is not only a green space, but it was also designed to absorb water during times of flooding. What a brilliant idea! I think there should be more of those in the future - ones that not only look good - but also help the environment in some way.$
489,Content Discussion,$ Buildings can be designed to recycle their own trash and turn it into compost which in turn creates rich soil for their living roof. Solar panels can not only provide power but also shade for shade-loving plants or shade in parks with benches built underneath. They can be embellished to go with the overall park theme. $
490,Outside Material,$Perhaps the stands they sit on can be made into mosaics like Gaudi's parks in Spain.$
491,Content Discussion,$There are so many wonderful ideas that can be implemented. $
492,Content Discussion,$Shaded walkways can have solar panels built into them, now that solar comes in flexible panels. They can be formed into arches.$
493,General Comment,$This was a brilliant article and I'd love to hear more about it.$
494,Greeting,$Hi Team, $
495,Opening Statement,$looking forward to seeing your responses. I've got the ball rolling.$
496,Response,$I completely agree with your statement, $
497,Content Discussion,$good design should take into account all aspects of reality and adapt to both the times and environment". $
498,Content Discussion,$Unfortunately  in many cases that goal is much harder to do than it is to say."$
499,Content Discussion,$I wonder if we could consider more ways that design has created a positive impact of change while dealing with the pandemic.$
500,Content Discussion,$I liked some of the examples given but I wonder if there were more.$
501,Content Discussion,$Notably, education has changed to deal with the changing situation. $
502,Content Discussion,$Could the switch to digital classrooms have had an effect on other social issues or climate issues?$
503,Greeting,$Hi Cassie, $
504,Logistics,$I emailed with you and Roger just to try and arrange a time when we can all be in the conversation on here at the same time, as Vanya suggested$
505,Logistics,$Roger will not be available Friday or over the weekend, so it would be nice if we could do a synchronous or semi-synchronous collaborative session at some point today.$
506,General Comment,$I still have to read the material...$
507,Assignment Instructions,$Finished the reading, now viewing the YouTube tutorial$
508,Assignment Instructions,$And now considering the questions$
509,General Comment ,$For part 2, looking through the article for prototype ideas before widening the thought process$
510,Response,$Copy, here now$
511,Content Discussion,$I thought it was an interesting exploration of future life under the guise of fear as communicated$
512,Content Discussion,$In design it is difficult to design to a future that does not exist and may no longer be relative in our future climate and culture$
513,Response,$Hi. Yes, I agree.$
514,Content Discussion,$With the onset of biological, climate and political unrest, where does typical learning occur?$
515,Content Discussion,$With the individual?$
516,Content Discussion,$The home life environment will no longer accommodate the typical learner, $
517,Content Discussion,$as parents will work to sustain a child will need supervision and technical accommodations to support the training outcomes.$
518,Content Discussion,$Therefore, a learner will need to abide by health guidelines to further their education. $
519,Content Discussion,$Parents unwilling, or unable will be scrutinized for not permitting their student to attend school.$
520,Response,$Right, $
521,Content Discussion,$issues of remote learning, impacts on children and families$
522,Content Discussion,$With political considerations impacting on how the whole in-person versus remote learning scenario is taking place.$
523,Content Discussion,$Wearing full headgear to protect from viral and biological contaminates will be the focus in future education. $
524,Content Discussion,$The headgear will accommodate protection from mouth, nose and ear contaminants ;$
525,Content Discussion,$as well as, provide two way communication to the and from the instructor.$
526,Content Discussion,$The first attempt will be to attend virtual education, $
527,Content Discussion,$but as the parental support networks erode, especially k-5, parents will insist their children attend school,$
528,Content Discussion,$so that the family continues to sustain financial support.$
529,Response,$Yikes, $
530,Response,$but yes, I can see that.$
531,Content Discussion,$Communication is definitely an issue with masks etc. $
532,Content Discussion,$Prototypes in this arena, then, relating to in-person but also to e-learning design, of course.$
533,Content Discussion,$COVID will mutate into COVID-20, 21, 22 and so on. $
534,Content Discussion,$Just like the flu shot they will be chasing the mutations, but there will not be an inoculation for it$
535,Content Discussion,$So we have to cope and live with it, in some fashion, with adaptations.$
536,Content Discussion,$full faced head gear with 5G to connect to networks and send/receive communication from teachers, $
537,Content Discussion,$students and peers will be the next fall-out when paper masks are communicated as no longer effective.$
538,Response,$yes.$
539,Response,$That, I like. $
540,Content Discussion,$It is futuristic and addresses issues of health, communication, education.$
541,Content Discussion,$Some level of augmented reality, too.$
542,Content Discussion,$Perhaps$
543,Content Discussion,$there may not be a cure, so may just need to accept and live with it. $
544,Content Discussion,$We may respond with duck and cover drills, or simply say I will do my best to prevent the spread and cotangent;$
545,Content Discussion,$however, living in fear will only keep us in bubbles waiting to pop.$
546,Content Discussion,$What do you mean by duck and cover drills?$
547,Response,$Absolutely, $
548,Content Discussion,$the AR may be broadcasted within the screen hosted from the 'Cyber Congressional Library $
549,Content Discussion,$AR assets tagged by authorized users then submitted and hosted online for AR headgear systems to display the AR overlays.$
550,Content Discussion,$I call it HITS. Health Information Technology.$
551,Content Discussion,$which reports Realtime vitals  such as temps  heart rate and eye movements."$
552,Response,$Cool$
553,Outside Material,$back during the cold war USA was overly concerned with Nuclear weapons being launched from Cuba. $
554,Outside Material,$Schools were taught to duck and cover under their desks to protect from a Nuclear weapon. $
555,Outside Material,$seriously hiding under a desk will do literally nothing except enable you to kiss your pants good bye.$
556,Response,$Ah, of course. I have heard of that...$
557,General Comment,$futile attempts$
558,Logistics,$you may have noticed I am translating these suggestions down into the collaborative response panel$
559,Content Discussion,$same effect with COVID, $
560,Content Discussion,$there is just really not a lot we can do except feel good by wearing a paper mask that the CDC already stated does little, or nothing to prevent the spread of viral airborne particulates.$
561,Content Discussion,$W e are only prevent saliva based sneezes and coughs.$
562,Content Discussion,$the Airborne COVID will stay floating in the air for 24-48 hours.$
563,Content Discussion,$Hmm. Let's get your HITS headgear developed instead.$
564,General Comment,$anyway, good times. and great opportunity to ride the fear train. $
565,Content Discussion,$we should start selling full headgear before anyone else. and throw in AR to make it really cool$
566,Content Discussion,$I have a few preliminary designs.$
567,Content Discussion,$I wish I could attach images into this, I would show you$
568,Response,$You do?$
569,Response,$Awesome$
570,Content Discussion,$That is definitely something that could be developed$
571,Content Discussion,$it essentially combines the Army's next gen helmet with AR and biological / viral filtration.$
572,Content Discussion,$A prototype involving AR should get backing I would think$
573,General Comment,$If you could get the images uploaded somewhere, a URL could be included here$
574,Outside Material,$https://www.army.mil/article/125327/Army_designing_next_generation_protective_mask/$
575,General Comment,$this is pretty close$
576,Assignment Instructions,$I know all the communication needs to stay within the discussion $
577,Assignment Instructions,$but a URL would be appropriate to include in the response, I think$
578,Response,$ok$
579,Content Discussion,$mine just ads AR and two way communication$
580,Response,$ok$
581,Outside Material,$here is another link$
582,Outside Material,$https://www.core77.com/firms/hsdesign/Next-Generation-Respiratory-Protection-System-NGRPS$
583,General Comment,$looking at these. $
584,General Comment (Narrative?),$considering possible design adaptation for children$
585,Content Discussion,$the first has a design and filter in the mask, $
586,Content Discussion,$the second has a backpack system by the looks of it$
587,Content Discussion,$yup, imagine fieldtrips with the learners scanning object in AR using the helmet, $
588,Content Discussion,$to include GEO tracking, proximity alerts and warnings$
589,Outside Material,$https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*MqJFT-uDEa1-Crmv.png$
590,Logistics,$can't edit the comments. $
591,Content Discussion,$not a 'design' and filter, a 'fan' and filter$
592,Content Discussion,$Yeah the Health Information Technology (HIT) system does not exist,$
593,Content Discussion,$ I was just envisioning it at being the next step.$
594,Response,$yes, I very much like the AR idea$
595,Response,$ok$
596,Response,$definitely$
597,Response,$OK,$
598,Content Discussion,$ that image is showing the wearer how far apart they are from someone$
599,Content Discussion,$yes, proximity alerts, OK$
600,Content Discussion,$this is so futuristic. $
601,Content Discussion,$we really are living in an apocalyptic movie$
602,Response,$of course…$
603,Content Discussion,$all AR definitions and all incoming and outgoing communications would be scanned, filtered and tagged by the FCC. $
604,Content Discussion,$Failure to abide by the world health organization mandates would lead yo to reeducation facilities$
605,Content Discussion,$As much fantasy as I am spinning in this, the Orwellian state is closing in.$
606,Response,$I'm laughing, $
607,Content Discussion,$but I am seeing the possibilities of that happening$
608,Logistics,$What do you think of the beginning collaborative response below?$
609,Content Discussion,$I wish it was only a movie, a script a sick twisted perversion of reality. $
610,Content Discussion,$Unfortunately, we are witnessing this play out in our very daily life.$
611,Content Discussion,$Who would have thought you would need to wear a mask to shop, or lock-down due to a pandemic.$
612,Content Discussion,$Wasn't this a Netflix horror movie. $
613,Content Discussion,$I suppose we are now livening in one.$
614,Content Discussion,$ - or are we just told to believe we are in one...$
615,Response,$good question$

654,Logistics,$How many sessions are required for the request?$
655,Response,$not specified$
656,General Comment,$sorry, just not understanding the assignment.$
657,Assignment Instructions,$and it didn't absolutely have to be everyone at the same time. $
658,Logistics,$so anything else could be me / Cassie individually. $
659,Logistics,$I'm sure she will want to make comments/input.$
660,Assignment Instructions,$Are we suppose to turn something in? $
661,Assignment Instructions,$I thought this was , just read the fear campaign then discus in the chat.$
662,Logistics,$Are you offline now through Thanksgiving?$
663,Response,$I'll be on until to morrow, $
664,Response,$ but seriously, $
665,Assignment Instructions,$what is the assignment here?$
666,Assignment Instructions,$I love chatting, but is there an objective?$
667,Assignment Instructions,$To write the collaborative response below.$
668,Response,$I am fine with your input$
669,Response,$okay, and we have.$
670,Logistics,$If you are fine with me and/or Cassie contributing some more$
671,Assignment Instructions,$and then the post-discussion survey$
672,Assignment Instructions,$of course the survey is individual$
673,Response,$I understand, $
674,General Comment,$I do not want to leave you with unfinished work.$
675,Assignment Instructions,$What may I do to further this assignment. $
676,Assignment Instructions,$ This is all truly vague and I feel as though I am in some sort of experiment in social chatting.$
677,Assignment Instructions,$Will there be additional details on the survey, $
678,Assignment Instructions,$I only received information about reading this book and chatting.$
679,Logistics,$I think we cannot avoid it being unfinished until Cassie has contributed.$
680,Assignment Instructions,$If you're logged into Canvas, the survey link is on this page $

682,Logistics,$so who submits this, and who do we submit our note to?$
683,Logistics,$I thought all of our chatter was tracked in this system.$
684,Response,$I assume it is. $
685,Assignment Instructions,$But the survey is separate. use that link and submit that there$
686,General Comment,$May I suggest $
687,Logistics,$if you have time to log on again tomorrow, any time before you leave, $
688,Logistics,$see if there are any new contributions for you to respond to?$
689,Logistics,$I will commit to making sure all the contributions are done and the 'SUBMITTED' tag is added once that is complete$
690,Response,$sure, no problem, $
